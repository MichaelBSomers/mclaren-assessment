**_Notes_**

\*Nothing is set to required. I'm taking the liberty to make them required otherwise the user can submit a blank form.

\*I don't understand what is suppoed to go in the bottom 'Sections' from the layout on the google doc, excluding it.

\*I'm adding an 'Answer' field to the base data, then returning the same data retrieved
with that field included.

\*generally as a rule I try to avoid using inline CSS but for readability and simplicity sake for this simply project I decided to use it for minor touches alongside BootStrap.

**_ChangeLog_**

\*\*form.json
\*Added Type field to TextBoxs to ensure customization of fields using html types.
\*Included extra Label to Page 2.
\*Added Placeholder to Textbox fields
\*Added checked default to true to Raffle.
